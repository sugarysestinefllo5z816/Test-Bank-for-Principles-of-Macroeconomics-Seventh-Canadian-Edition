  * Principles of Macroeconomics, Seventh Canadian Edition, is designed to appeal to all students through its breakdown of concepts, focus on big ideas, and user-friendly language. As the market leader, its clear, concise, and consistent approach grounds students in difficult concepts and links theory to real-world applications, assisting in making the connection from page to action. Students receive a sophisticated understanding of how the economy operates without losing the big ideas through various pedagogical features that summarize major concepts, apply economic theory to students’ experiences and lives, and develop the building blocks required to achieve higher levels of understanding. As Mankiw states, “My goal in writing my text was to try and remember and to write a text that I would have liked to have read”, and this is the same approach he, Kneebone, and McKenzie have continued with the Seventh Canadian Edition.
